#   1. No .go source files leak into the tarball. The repo vendors the `rune`
#      Go submodule and builds extension_python from it, so a stray copy of Go
#      sources into pkg/ would ship source into the release. The payload must
#      contain only the compiled extension_python binary, the toolchain
#      binaries, the tree-sitter .so, the .scm queries, and config.yaml.
